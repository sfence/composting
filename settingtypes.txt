# Compost clod cost
#
# If compost is optimally fulled, it takes around 20 minutes for one compost clod to be finished (time_divider set to 3600) in normal composter and around 3 minutes in electric composter (electric_composter_time set to 10).
#
composting_clod_cost (How much amount of compost cost compost clod) int 25

# Basic composting speed is one year.
# Minetest use default day length 20 minutes, which means that time is divided by 72.
# time_divider   72  -> ideal composting time 122 hours. 
# time_divider  720  -> ideal composting time 12 hours. 
# time_divider 3600  -> ideal composting time 2.5 hours. 
# time_divider 7200  -> ideal composting time 1.25 hours.
